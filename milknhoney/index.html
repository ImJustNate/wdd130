        <h2>Milk and honey homestead is home to the grandparents; Megan and Kenneth Welling. It is an inviting place for their children and grandchildren alike. It is a place of fun and chaos. It is a place where grandma always has something to spoil her wards with. Whether that be with candie cookies, ice cream or good food. This hobby farm is home to bees, cows, chickens, gardens and even her very own husband, a monkey just like the rest of her children.</h2>
