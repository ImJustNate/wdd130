      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Milk and honey homestead is home to the grandparents; Megan and Kenneth Welling. It is an inviting place for their children and grandchildren alike. It is a place of fun and chaos. It is a place where grandma always has something to spoil her wards with. Whether that be with candie cookies, ice cream or good food. This hobby farm is home to bees, cows, chickens, gardens and even her very own husband, a monkey just like the rest of her children.

      <h3>Cows and Milk</h3>
      <p>
        Paris is a Jersey cow and produces about 3 gallons of milk a day. Which seems nice until you realize that that is about 90 gallons of milk a month. She is a puppy cow and when we first got her she would cry at the top of the yard until someone came to play with her or she was too horse to keep baying.

        Roxy was born May fifth twenty twenty three and couldn't figure out how to drink milk and so farmer Megan brought her to the vet and the vet said that calf Roxy would be ok but she hadn't seen a cow so dumb and brings to mind the phrase dumb as rocks. To this day if her schedule is changed roxy panics and gets confused.

        Milk made foods. Megan has been perfecting the art of making cheese. She has perfected farmhouse cheddar really well every time.  Megan can make mozzarella about 50% of the time. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it is as hard as a rock. Weekly she makes yogurt, cottage cheese, buttermilk sour cream, ice cream, and pudding. Right now she is practicing aged cheeses such as parmesan and romano.
        
        Disclaimer At this time milk and honey homesteads are not legally allowed to sell milk or dairy products due to a lack of license.

      </ul>
      <h3>The Milkers</h3>
      <p>
        Megan top dog some would title her the fastest milker in the west. Every morning rain or shine she is out in the barn milking Paris. She is the one who works the hardest. Megan milks, makes cheese, mucks the stalls, buys the straw and hay, and runs the farm hands.

        Kenneth is the full time farm hand. Due to his other job cannot milk daily but helps on the weekends with the milking and other farm chores. Such as harvesting fruit, repairing the vehicles and milking.

        Rebekah is a summer farm hand and is one of the best milking buddies that Megan has. When needed, Rebekah also helps with farm chores, harvesting produce and filtering the milk.

        Nate is a hard working and helpful farm hand who is always willing to help with anything whether it be milking, moving cinder blocks or moving compost. He comes around in the winter. He also uses copious amounts of the butter and eggs produced by the farm to make fancy bread products.

        Hazel is the relief farm hand and is always willing to help out when needed
