        <p><i>Paris</i> is a Jersey cow and produces about <i>3 gallons of milk a day</i>. Which seems nice until you realize that that is about 90 gallons of milk a month. She is a <i>puppy cow</i> and when we first got her she would cry at the top of the yard until someone came to play with her or she was too horse to keep baying.

        <i>Roxy</i> was <i>born May fifth twenty twenty three</i> and couldn't figure out how to drink milk and so farmer Megan brought her to the vet and the vet said that calf, Roxy, would be ok but she hadn't seen a cow so dumb and brings to mind the phrase dumb as rocks. <i>To this day if her schedule is changed roxy panics and gets confused.</i>

        <h6><i>Milk made foods.</i>Megan has been perfecting the art of making cheese. She has perfected <i>farmhouse cheddar</i> really well every time.  Megan can make <i>mozzarella</i> about 50% of the time. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it is as hard as a rock. Weekly <b>she makes yogurt, cottage cheese, buttermilk sour cream, ice cream, and pudding.</b> Right now she is practicing aged cheeses such as <i>parmesan and romano.</i>
